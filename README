This is the Summoner Game designed to be played in the virtual world of Sirikata.

To play the game, have one avatar in the world import SummonerInitEasy.em

That avatar will become the game host. Now, all avatars that send a touch message
by pressing 'enter' will get the game script sent to their entity. 

The script will automatically run, and they will be in the game!

There are currently a couple of bugs in the game. 

For developers who are interested in changing the game:
In each file, there is a short description of what the file is supposed to do.
In each function, there is a short description of what it does.

SummonerMonster.em handles all combat logic.
SummonerMain.em initializes the whole script.
SummonerNews.em sets up the listeners for messages for the player avatar.
